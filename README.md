Reflection

It is designed to engage the public and to provide an opportunity for people to gain a deeper understanding of Canberra, a city of beautiful nature, peaceful surroundings and art festivals.

Several improvements have been made to the page, such as a mobile-friendly design that allows users to experience the website on different devices such as laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. 

The most important thing for a webpage is to have a meaningful title and a short sentence explanation so that the audience isn't bored reading too many words.
